# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Data

Sentiment analysis is the process of computationally identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in a piece of text, especially in order to determine whether the writer's attitude towards a particular topic, product, etc. is positive, negative, or neutral.

# Objective: To analyze the sentences for determining emotions like  
o Texts containing positive emotions; happiness, amusement or joy, \n 
o Texts containing negative emotions; disappointment, anger or disappointment, \n
o Texts containing neutral emotions.


This is done by using supervised learning techniques such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm. 

Itâ€™s an important application that could serve as a tool to help businesses monitor brand and product sentiment in customer feedback, and understand customer needs. The analysis helps spot negative or positive sentiments about their product or service with precision, and take necessary steps to address those areas.
